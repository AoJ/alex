Alex Dialogue System Framework 
==============================

The framework is named after the famous parrot Alex: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_(parrot)

This framework is being developed by the dialogue systems group at UFAL - http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/ - (the Institute of Formal and Applied Linguistics), Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Charles University in Prague, Czech Republic. The purpose of this work is to facilitate research into and development of spoken dialogue systems.  

The main goals are:

- provide baseline components need for a building spoken dialogue systems (SDSs)
- provide example implementations of SDSs for several domains
- provide tools for processing dialogue system interactions logs, e.g. for audio transcription, semantic annotations, or SDSs evaluation
