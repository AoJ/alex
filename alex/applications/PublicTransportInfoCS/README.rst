Public Transport Info telephone service
============================================================

Description
-----------
Public Transport Info telephone service (previously called Alex On The Bus) provides information, as the name suggests,
about public transport. At this moment, it provides only information about public transport in Prague, Czech republic.
It offers bus, tram and metro connections. The system will ask you origin and destination stops.
You can ask for the immediate connection or the connections at some particular time.


Representation of semantics
---------------------------
Suggestion (MK): It would be better to treat the specification of hours and
minutes separately. When they are put together, all ways the whole time
expression can be said have to be enumerated in the CLDB manually.
