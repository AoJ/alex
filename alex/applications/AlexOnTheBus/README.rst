Public Transport Info telephone service
============================================================

Description
-----------
Public Transport Info telephone service (also called Alex On The Bus) provides information, as the name suggests,
about public transport in Czech. At this moment, it provides only information about public transport in Prague.
It offers, bus, tram and metro connections. The system will ask you from where and where to you are going.
You can ask for the immediate connection or the connections at some particular time.


Representation of semantics
---------------------------
Suggestion (MK): It would be better to treat the specification of hours and
minutes separately. When they are put together, all ways the whole time
expression can be said have to be enumerated in the CLDB manually.
