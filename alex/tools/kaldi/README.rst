Building of acoustic models using KALDI
=======================================

In this document, we describe building of acoustic models 
using the KALDI toolkit using the provided scripts.
These acoustic models can be used with the *Kaldi* decoders
and especially with the Python wrapper of ``LatgenFasterDecoder``
which is integrated with Alex.

We build a different acoustic for a each language and acoustic condition 
pair â€“ ``LANG_RCOND``. At this time, we provide two sets of scripts for 
building English and Czech acoustic models using the VOIP data.

In general, the scripts can be described for the language and acoustic 
condition ``LANG_RCOND`` as follows:

IMPORTANT
---------
Use ``irstlm 5.8`` and higher! 
*TODO* Choose another LM (KennLM) tool since Kaldi already uses patched ``IRSTLM 5.6``,
which does not correctly create arpa model in textual represenattion!

Summary
-------
* Requires KALDI installation and Linux environment. (Tested on Ubuntu 10.04, 12.04 and 12.10.)
* Recipes Kaldi toolkit are located ``KALDI_ROOT/egs/name_of_recipe/s5/``. 
   This recipe also expects that you copy the directory which contains this ``README.rst`` under ``KALDI_ROOT/egs``,
   or that you have Kaldi binaries and in your path.



Details
-----------
* Our scripts prepare the data to expected format in s5/data
* Stores experiments in s5/exp
* steps is a symlink to ``KALDI_ROOT/wsj/s5/utils`` scripts which are distributed with Kaldi
* utils is a symlink to ``KALDI_ROOT/wsj/s5/utils`` scripts which are distributed with Kaldi
* Directory ``local`` contains scripts for data preparation to prepare ``data`` structure.
* ``path.sh``, ``cmd.sh`` and  ``conf/*`` contain configurations for the recipe
* Language Model (LM) is either built from the training data using [IRSTLM](http://sourceforge.net/projects/irstlm/)  or we supply one in ARPA format


Running experiments
--------------------
Before running the experiments check following points:
 * You have compiled Kaldi toolkit http://sourceforge.net/projects/kaldi/
 * You have compiled IRSTLM. (For building a language model (LM) if you don't supply your own LM in arpa format) http://sourceforge.net/projects/irstlm/
 * The run.sh script will see the Kaldi binaries. There are two options:
    - Copy this directory into ``KALDI_ROOT/egs``. (Recommended)
    - The Kaldi binaries are in your ``PATH`` variable and fix the ``utils`` and ``steps`` symlinks.
 * Check path links in ``conf`` directory to data and that the set up fits your needs. 
 * Check ``path.sh`` for path to Kaldi binaries and number of jobs parameter, ``njobs``. 
 * In ``cmd.sh`` you can switch to run the training on SGE grid (disabled by default).

Start the recipe from by running ``bash run.sh``.
It will create ``mfcc``, ``data`` and ``exp`` directories.
If any of them exists, it will ask you if you want them to be overwritten.
After running the experiments the ``exp`` directory will be backup to ``Results`` directory.

Extracting the results and trained models
-------------------------------------------
The main ``run.sh`` script performs not only training the acoustic models,
but also decoding.
The acoustic models are evaluated during running the scripts and are printed to the standard output.

The ``local/results.py exp`` command extracts the results from the ``exp`` directory.
It is invoked at the end of the ``run.sh`` script and the results are stored to ``exp/results.log``.

If you want to use the trained acoustic model outside the prepared script,
you need to build ``HCLG`` decoding graph yourself. 
(See http://kaldi.sourceforge.net/graph.html for general introduction to FST framework in Kaldi.)

The simplest way how to start with decoding is to use the same LM which
was used by the ``run.sh`` script.  
Let say you want to decode with acoustic model stored in ``exp/tri1``,
then you need just 3 files:
- ``exp/tri1/graph/HCLG.fst``   # decoding graph
- ``exp/tri1/graph/words.txt``  # Word symbol table, a mapping between words and integers which are decoded.
- ``exp/tri1/final.mdl``        # trained acoustic model 

For details see the ``run.sh`` script and especially the parts where the ``steps/decode.sh`` is used. 
The ``steps/decode.sh`` wraps the decoding with Kaldi binaries.
