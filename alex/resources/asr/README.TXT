This directory contains acoustic models for different languages and 
recording conditions. It is assumed that only one acoustic model per 
language will be build regarding the domain.

However, one can build different acoustic models for different recording 
settings, e.g. one for VOIP and the other for desktop mic recordings.

Up to now, only VOIP acoustic models have been trained.

The `reports' directory contains some evaluation data for the models 
trained.
