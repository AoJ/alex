= Definiotion of dialogue acts =

Dialogue acts represent basic intents and the semantic content in the input utterance.
Dialogue act is composed multiple items.
Each dialogue act item is defined as tuple composed of a dialogue act type, a slot name, and the slot value.

DA = (DAI)+

DAI = (DAT, SN, SV)

DAT = (inform, deny, request, confirm, select, affrim, negate,


Examples are:


hello()                               start dialogue "Hi"

silence()                             user did not say anything

thankyou()                            "Thanks"

ack()                                 "Ok" - back channel

bye()                                 end dialogue - simple "Good bye"

hangup()                              user hangs-up


inform(food=French)                   "I see that you want French food"

deny(food=Italian)                    "I do not want Italian food"

request(food)                         "Can tell what food do they serve in the restaurant?"

confirm(food=Italian)                 "Do they serve Italian food?"

select(food=Italian,food=French,...)  "Do you want Italian or French food or ...."


affirm()                              simple "Yes"

negate()                              simple "No"

reqalts()                             ask for alternatives - "Do you have something else?"

reqmore()                             ask for more details - "Can you tell me more about the offer?"

apology()                             apology for misunderstanding - "Sorry, I did not get that"

repeat()                              request to repeat the last act - "Can you repeat that"

help()                                request for help - "Can you help me?"

restart()                             request to restart - "I want to start again"

null()                                something that is not interpretable, does nothing. 
                                      It can be also used when converting dialogue act item confusion network into the N-best list
                                      hold all probability mass connected with all dialogue acts which were not added to the N-best list 
                                      (in other words probability mass of prunned da hypotheses). 
                                      This can significantly help the DM inference algorithm. 





Exact set of dialogue acts depends on a specific application domain and is defined by the domain specific semantic parser.

The only requirement is that all the output of a parser must be accepted by the dialogue manager developed for the particular domain.


Consider the following:
    ADAMACH taxonomy [10], a compact version of DAMSL consisting of 16 DA classes:
    core (info-request, action-request, yes-answer, no-answer, answer, offer, report-action, inform),
    conventional (greet, quit, apology, thank), and
    feedback (clarif-request, ack, filler),
    with the addition of other and non-interpretable: other is used for something that can be interpreted but with so low probability so that it is not worth having on N-best list,  non-interpretable means that we do not understand and the system response should be "I did not get that. Could you rephrase that?"
