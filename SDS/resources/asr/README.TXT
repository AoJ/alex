This directoru contains acoustic model for different languages and recording conditions. It is assumed that only one acoustic model per language will be build reegarding the domain.
However, one can build different acoustic models for different recording settings e.g. one for VOIP and the other for desktop mic recordings.

At this momment, only VOIP acoustic models are being created.
