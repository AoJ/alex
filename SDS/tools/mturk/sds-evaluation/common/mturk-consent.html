<h4>STATEMENT OF CONSENT</h4>

<p>
    You have volunteered to participate in a study conducted in the
    Department of Engineering at the University of Cambridge.
</p>
<p>
    This study is concerned with how people interact with spoken
    dialogue systems. In the course of this study, you will be
    interacting with different dialogue systems. All interactions with

    study. After completion of the task(s) you will be asked several
    questions about your experiences. There are no known expected
    physical discomforts or
    risks involved in your participation.
